/*
 * Analysis Answers
 *
 * B4 - Partition and recursive control
 * After the first partition, identify the pivot code, its returned index, and
 * the two next ranges. Is the whole catalog already sorted? Explain using data.
 * Answer: The first partition uses the pivot code 35, which is returned at index 3.
 * The two next ranges are [0, 2] and [4, 7].
 * The whole catalog is not yet sorted because the elements in the left range [48, 21, 14]
 * and the right range [57, 63, 72] are not in order. Further recursive calls will sort these subarrays.
 *
 * B5 - A search that fails
 * Trace the recursive search for code 36. List each first, last, middle,
 * inspected code, and next range. At the empty range, explain which calls resume
 * and how -1 reaches main without an invalid array access.
 * Answer:
 * firt = 0, last = 7, middle = 3, inspected code = 35, next range = [4, 7]
 * first = 4, last = 7, middle = 5, inspected code = 57, next range = [4, 4]
 * first = 4, last = 4, middle = 4, inspected code = 48, next range = [4, 3]
 * first = 4, last = 3, middle = 3, inspected code = N/A, next range = empty
 * The recursive calls resume back up the call stack, returning -1 at each level until it
